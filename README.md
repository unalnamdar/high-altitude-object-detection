# High-Altitude Small Object Detection Project

## Objective
Develop a deep learning pipeline to detect small objects (e.g., vehicles, people, animals) from high-altitude imagery captured by drones.

## Tools and Technologies
- Object Detection Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Dataset Management: Roboflow
- Development Environment: Python 3.10+, PyCharm
- Image Processing: OpenCV
- Real-Time Inference: Webcam or recorded video streams

## Project Goals
- Achieve high accuracy in detecting small-scale objects at high altitudes
- Perform real-time inference with minimal latency
- Understand and optimize API integration and model deployment processes

## Workflow Overview
1. Dataset preparation or selection
2. Fine-tuning or training a YOLOv8 model
3. Building a real-time inference pipeline
4. Measuring inference latency and performing system optimizations
